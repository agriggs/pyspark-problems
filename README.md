# PySpark Problems

Based on various interview quesitons, show how I would solve. 

Using GitHub Copilot, found I need to be somewhat specific in "prompts" but overall good experience using Copilot

If I did end up interviewing, I would do about 10-20 revs of problems without using Copilot since I don't think companies would allow
